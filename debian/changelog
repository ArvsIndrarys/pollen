anerd (1.1) unreleased; urgency=low

  * anerd.c:
    - define the default total exchange size
    - also define and use a default payload size
    - break up the total exchange to a bunch of smaller payloads, to increase
      the randomness of UDP packet ordering and timing
    - improve some inline documentation
    - lower logging to debug from info
    - allocate an extra byte for the data binary string
    - use a separate pointer for segmenting and moving through the data string
    - no need for null-bytes, since binary data could have null bytes within
    - alphabetize includes

    - use a common function for salt calculation
    - implement a very simple checksum of random data
    - use uint64_t for platform compatibility

  [ Wesley Wiedenmeier ]
  * anerd.c:
    - use getopt for command line parsing
    - Modified code to fork twice then kill the parent process,
      freeing the terminal that spawns the daemons, added daemonize()
      function to safely daemonize the program.
    - Improved entering into daemon status by moving daemon() call to
      after intilization of server and client, so that errors
      encountered in intilization are written to the terminal.
