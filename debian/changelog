anerd (1.1-0ubuntu1) quantal; urgency=low

  * anerd.c:
    - define the default total exchange size
    - also define and use a default payload size
    - break up the total exchange to a bunch of smaller payloads, to increase
      the randomness of UDP packet ordering and timing
    - improve some inline documentation
    - lower logging to debug from info
    - allocate an extra byte for the data binary string
    - use a separate pointer for segmenting and moving through the data string
    - no need for null-bytes, since binary data could have null bytes within
    - alphabetize includes
    - change perrors to syslog errors
    - move daemon() function
  * Makefile.am:
    - fix up the build, clean out the binary and log files
  * anerd.c, anerd-client, debian/control, debian/cron.d,
    debian/default, debian/install, Makefile.am:
    - drop the anerd client in the C program entirely
    - the C program is now the server exclusively
    - add a bash script client, which can loop over a pool of anerd servers,
      and broadcast to the local network
    - recommend the socat package/utility, which is used to broadcast to the
      local network from the bash script
    - add a cron job to run the anerd-client regularly
    - add a default configuration file for configuring the pool and other
      tunables
    - remove the unnessary install file

  * === added directory debian, === added directory debian/source,
    anerd, debian/compat, debian/control, debian/copyright,
    debian/install, debian/rules, debian/source/format, debian/upstart:
    - added packaging
  * anerd, anerd.conf, debian/install, debian/upstart:
    - add a configuration file
    - run as daemon (non-root) user
  * anerd.c, AUTHORS, ChangeLog, configure.ac, COPYING,
    debian/copyright, debian/upstart, INSTALL, Makefile.am, NEWS,
    README:
    - ported from python to C
    - added autoconf/automake build
    - changed license from GPLv3 to Apache2.0 for portability to other
      UNIX platforms
  * anerd.conf, debian/control, debian/install, debian/upstart:
    - drop conf file, add options to upstart script
    - update build deps
  * anerd.c:
    - use syslog, open files/sockets only once per fork
    - catch all responses to a client broadcast
    - use a common function for salt calculation
    - implement a very simple checksum of random data
    - use uint64_t for platform compatibility
    - add entropy to pool in client read
    - simplify salt generation
    - simplify log printing
    - whitespace changes only, 80 char width
  * debian/install:
    - drop installation of default file

  [ Wesley Wiedenmeier ]
  * anerd.c:
    - use getopt for command line parsing
    - Modified code to fork twice then kill the parent process,
      freeing the terminal that spawns the daemons, added daemonize()
      function to safely daemonize the program.
    - Improved entering into daemon status by moving daemon() call to
      after intilization of server and client, so that errors
      encountered in intilization are written to the terminal.
