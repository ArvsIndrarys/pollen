  [ Wesley Wiedenmeier ]
  * anerd.c:
    - use getopt for command line parsing
    - Modified code to fork twice then kill the parent process,
      freeing the terminal that spawns the daemons, added daemonize()
      function to safely daemonize the program.
    - Improved entering into daemon status by moving daemon() call to
      after intilization of server and client, so that errors
      encountered in intilization are written to the terminal.
