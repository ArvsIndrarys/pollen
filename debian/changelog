anerd (1.4) unreleased; urgency=low

  [ Dustin Kirkland ]
  * anerd-tcp.go:
    - add a very small, basic anerd-tcp server
    - clean up via gofmt
  * anerd-client:
    - count the number of bytes received correctly using a tmpfile
    - adjust info messages slightly
  * anerd.c:
    - drop crc from logging, change messages to info from debug
  * debian/anerd-client.default:
    - default to anerd.gazzang.net now that its up for good
  * anerd-tcp, anerd-tcp.go, debian/anerd-tcp-common.install,
    debian/anerd-tcp.postinst, debian/anerd-tcp.upstart, debian/anerd-
    web.upstart, debian/control:
    - create two small packages, one to launch anerd-tcp->80 and
      anerd-tcp->443
      + both depend on anerd-tcp-common, which provides the go script
    - add a postinst that generates a self-signed cert if there is none;
      obviously, one would want to replace these with real certs if
      security matters to you
    - create two upstart scripts that start the web service on each port
      + means you can install one, or the other, or both
  * anerd-client, debian/anerd-client.default:
    - fix communication with remote servers
    - make the wait time configurable, 0.1s by default
    - only broadcast when no specific servers are specified
    - add message on broadcast bytes sent
  * === added directory initramfs, === added directory initramfs/hooks,
    === added directory initramfs/scripts, === added directory
    initramfs/scripts/init-bottom, debian/anerd-client.install,
    debian/anerd-client.postinst, debian/control, initramfs/hooks/anerd-
    client, initramfs/scripts/init-bottom/anerd-client:
    - add an initramfs hook that fetches entropy at boot
  * anerd-tcp:
    - add interpreter
  * anerd-tcp.1, debian/anerd-tcp-common.manpages:
    - add documentation
  * anerd-tcp.go:
    - ensure that we read enough bytes
  * anerd.1 => anerd-udp.1, anerd.c => anerd-udp.c, anerd-web.1 =>
    anerd-tcp.1, anerd-web => anerd-tcp, anerd-web.go => anerd-tcp.go,
    debian/anerd-server.anerd-udp.upstart, debian/anerd-server.default,
    debian/anerd-server.install, debian/anerd-server.manpages,
    debian/anerd-server.upstart => debian/anerd-server.anerd-

    server.postinst, debian/anerd-webs.upstart, debian/anerd-
    web.upstart, debian/control, debian/rules, Makefile.am:
    - rename the C program to anerd-udp

anerd (1.2-0ubuntu1) raring; urgency=low

  [ Dustin Kirkland ]
  * debian/control, debian/cron.d:
    - use run-one for cronjob
  * anerd-client:
    - clean up client, make more modular, remove some variables, uses pipes
      to keep everything in memory
  * debian/anerd-client.install, debian/anerd-server.install,
    debian/control, debian/copyright, debian/cron.d => debian/anerd-
    client.cron.d, debian/default => debian/anerd-client.default,
    debian/upstart => debian/anerd-server.upstart:
    - split package into a server and client package, with a meta
      package depending on both
  * anerd.1, anerd-client.1:
    - manpage fixes
  * debian/anerd-client.cron.d, debian/anerd-client.default:
    - add some inline documentation
    - use the default file for setting defaults (ie, uncomment)
  * debian/control:
    - bump standards
  * debian/anerd-server.manpages, debian/manpages => debian/anerd-
    client.manpages, Makefile.am:
    - install manpages (perhaps there's a better automake way of doing this?)
  * anerd.c:
    - rename "sum" to "crc"
  * debian/anerd-server.upstart:
    - upstart needs to expect the fork
    - upstart does not need to sudo to the daemon user because anerd does
      this automatically
  * anerd-client:
    - use a $cmd variable populated with correct parameters
  * anerd-client, debian/control:
    - reluctantly add support for netcat
  * anerd-client, anerd-client.1:
    - use a default file for configuration
  * anerd-client:
    - emulate the syslog printing from the server

  [ Wesley Wiedenmeier ]
  * anerd.c, anerd-client, debian/default:
    - add ipv6 support
  * anerd.1, anerd.c, anerd-client.1, debian/manpages:
    - added manpages
    - dropped unused global

anerd (1.1-0ubuntu1) quantal; urgency=low

  * anerd.c:
    - define the default total exchange size
    - also define and use a default payload size
    - break up the total exchange to a bunch of smaller payloads, to increase
      the randomness of UDP packet ordering and timing
    - improve some inline documentation
    - lower logging to debug from info
    - allocate an extra byte for the data binary string
    - use a separate pointer for segmenting and moving through the data string
    - no need for null-bytes, since binary data could have null bytes within
    - alphabetize includes
    - change perrors to syslog errors
    - move daemon() function
  * Makefile.am:
    - fix up the build, clean out the binary and log files
  * anerd.c, anerd-client, debian/control, debian/cron.d,
    debian/default, debian/install, Makefile.am:
    - drop the anerd client in the C program entirely
    - the C program is now the server exclusively
    - add a bash script client, which can loop over a pool of anerd servers,
      and broadcast to the local network
    - recommend the socat package/utility, which is used to broadcast to the
      local network from the bash script
    - add a cron job to run the anerd-client regularly
    - add a default configuration file for configuring the pool and other
      tunables
    - remove the unnessary install file

      UNIX platforms
  * anerd.conf, debian/control, debian/install, debian/upstart:
    - drop conf file, add options to upstart script
    - update build deps
  * anerd.c:
    - use syslog, open files/sockets only once per fork
    - catch all responses to a client broadcast
    - use a common function for salt calculation
    - implement a very simple checksum of random data
    - use uint64_t for platform compatibility
    - add entropy to pool in client read
    - simplify salt generation
    - simplify log printing
    - whitespace changes only, 80 char width
  * debian/install:

  [ Wesley Wiedenmeier ]
  * anerd.c:
    - use getopt for command line parsing
    - Modified code to fork twice then kill the parent process,
      freeing the terminal that spawns the daemons, added daemonize()
      function to safely daemonize the program.
    - Improved entering into daemon status by moving daemon() call to
      after intilization of server and client, so that errors
      encountered in intilization are written to the terminal.
